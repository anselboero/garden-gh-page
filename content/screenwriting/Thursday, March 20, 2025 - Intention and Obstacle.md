INT. - ANA AND MARK APARTMENT - NIGHT

It's dinner time. A pot is almost boiling. MARK is cutting
some zucchini, ANA is sitting at the table typing on her
laptop. Dim light coming from a lamp fixed to the ceiling,
above the table where Ana is working.

                         MARK
            Today, at the screenwriting
            masterclass, we've been taught the
            importance of having a solid
            Intention and a realistic Obstacle.

                         ANA
                    (She is still very
                    focused on her
                    work)
            Mmh, interesting. Intention and
            Obstacle?

                         MARK
            Yes, without them, you won't have a
            story. Let me give you an example:
            The main character is training hard
            every day because she wants to
            complete a marathon. You might say,
            "Okay, why is this story so
            special?" It's not. But if I say
            "the main character wants to
            complete a marathon to show himself
            that she is stronger than the cancer
            she was diagnosed with a few months ago",
            then we have both, a clear intention
            and a very strong obstacle. You
            might also feel more closer to her,
            you might sense empathy. And the
            obstacle is a real monster, it's not
            something that you can easily deal
            with. Facing it requires strength,
            steadiness, passion.

                         ANA
            Interesting. But I wonder, is having
            an intention really necessary? Let's
            suppose we want to write the story
            about ourselves. We are a normal
            couple, with normal lives. But I
            would still pay a ticket for a movie
            telling about the ordinary things.
            There is no need to make everything
            so magnificent.

ANA stops looking at the screen and rounds the face towards
MARK

                         ANA (cont'd)
            A few weeks ago we watched Perfect
            Days, you remember? The man who is
            caring about his work and his
            plants, and he loves his routine. He
            is a normal person, and I don't see
            clear intentions neither unbearable
            obstacles in this movie. Despite
            this, I really loved it and I felt
            engaged with him and the story.

                         MARK
            Let me think. Indeed, the intention
            is probably that one: enjoying every
            single moment of the life, without
            desiring power or money. And the
            main obstacle to this desire is the
            society itself, which is somehow
            navigating in the opposite
            direction: we are all in a hurry,
            and we don't care about each other.
            This is a very huge obstacle. And
            the final scene is very ambiguous,
            I'm not sure he was able to fully
            achieve his intentions.

                         ANA
            That's a good way to see it.

There is a small pause. the only sound comes from the pot
which is now boiling.

                         ANA (cont'd)
            What are you preparing for dinner?
