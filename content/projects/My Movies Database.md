title: My Movies Database
---
I love movies. And I love data. 
What about a spreadsheet storing all the movies and tv series I will be watching over my life?

Yes, if you work in tech, in data, especially, you might argue with me through the infamous "*Excel is not a Database*" quote. But I think that Excel is a very versatile and functional tool for projects like this one. It's free, easy to use, lightweight and an all-in one solution: "Backend" and "FrontEnd" are both stored on a single spreadsheet.

Every movie is saved automatically to a sheet through a Google App Script function which, given an [IMDB movie ID](https://developer.imdb.com/documentation/key-concepts#imdb-ids) as an input, will store all the main details about the movie itself.
I can add then some additional information, such the watching date, my personal rating, and a short comment (I do usually tend to train my [logline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_line#:~:text=A%20log%20line%20or%20logline,Guide%20is%20a%20log%20line.) skills).

You can have a look at [my personal spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1evnjLFzM3apXph0sUahqcbCwuEKCeAZh6bp3bdshSm4/edit?gid=1990214244#gid=1990214244). The most interesting Tabs are `MoviesDB`, the actual database where all the movies and series are stored, and `Movies - Dashboard`, containing some initial tiles generated from my movies watchlist.
There are also some other interesting sheets, such as `APIs`, used to generate my recently watched footnote feature, but I might dedicate a special post to them.

If you like it, and you would like to create your personal Movies Database too, you can follow the setup instructions from [this](https://github.com/anselboero/my-movies-database/tree/main) Github Repository.

Let me know if you have questions or suggestions (about movies, too), I'd love to hear more from you.
