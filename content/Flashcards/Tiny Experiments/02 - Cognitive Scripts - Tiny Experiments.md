# Summary

![[Cognitive Scripts - Tiny Experiments.svg]]

([Psychological status of the script concept](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1982-04621-001), Abelson, 1981)
- Internalized patterns govern our thoughts, actions, decision-making.
- Programmed instructions we follow based on our past experiences:
- <span style="color:green;">(+) Confidence, reduce fear of the unknown </span>
- <span style="color:red;">(-) Confine us within artificial boundaries, limiting perception of what is possible. </span>
## Sequel Script: Follow our Past
- Life like ruts-rails: difficult to go opposite direction
- self-consistency fallacy: always acted in a certain way, I must continue to act in this way
Reminds me of::: Sunk Cost Fallacy

## Crowdpleaser Script: Follow the crowd
- Adjusting decisions to meet expectations of a group.
- Society has ingrained standards, milestones we must reach if we want to be accepted / be successful.

## The Epic Script: Follow our passion
