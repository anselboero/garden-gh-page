INT. ANA AND MARK APARTMENT - MORNING

ANA and MARK are sleeping in their bedroom. After a few
seconds the alarm starts ringing. It's 7.00AM. With a slow
movement and with some grunts, Mark stops the Alarm.
He is stretching himself with some movements, without
leaving his position. After a few seconds, he starts
talking

                         MARK
                    (still grunting a
                    little)
            Mmh, good morning, my darling.

                         ANA
                    (grunting and
                    slowing speaking,
                    as if she is still
                    sleepy)
            Morning! What time is it?

                         MARK
            It's breakfast time! What would you
            like? Scrambled or poached eggs?

                         ANA
            Mmh, please, just a cup of coffee.
            I'm feeling so nervous that if I eat
            something I might reject it in a few
            hours.

                         MARK
            What's going on? Is is because of
            the job interview?

                         ANA
            Yes, Indeed. Today is the day.

                         MARK
            So it's almost done.

                         ANA
            Yes, today there will be the final
            part with the one who'd be the boss
            of my boss.

Mark is getting up.

                         ANA (cont'd)
            I'm very tired of my current
            position, I hope I will make it
            through.

                         MARK
            You will. I'm so impatient to
            prepare scrambled eggs for you
            again.
