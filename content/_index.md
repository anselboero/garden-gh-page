# Welcome

Here, you’ll find reflections around my main interests: data, critical thinking, personal finance, software, cognitivism, and mathematics.

I primarily write for myself: improving your writing [helps](https://paulgraham.com/writes.html)improve your thinking. However, I’ll be glad if some of my content proves useful to you as well.    

The folder structure is heavily inspired by [[./references/people/Jacky Zhao| JZhao]] [website](https://jzhao.xyz/) (Even though my personal Obsidian is following the [PARA Method](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/), and I like the idea of living documents: I might one day shift the blog to this different structure):
- In [Essays](/essays/) you will find my most curated posts.
- I'm learning screenwriting. I'm [writing](/screenwriting/) a screenplay. A scene per day. Every day.
- [Thoughts](/thoughts) contains considerations around topics which were resonating sound during the writing period. They are dirtier than the Essays and I expect to update them over the time.
- In [Projects](/projects) are documented some of the projects I've worked on.
- [Notes](/notes/) contains condensed blocks of knowledge on a specific subject, and can be used as appendix to the essays and thoughts.

You may be interested on some specific topics; the [Tags](/tags) page will group the essays and thoughts by tags.
