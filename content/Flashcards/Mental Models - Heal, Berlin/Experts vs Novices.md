# Summary

![[02 - Experts vs Novices - Mental Models.svg]]

- Experts hold more information than novices but what really makes the difference is how they organize their knowledge:
  **Information as a series of interrelated concepts, called `schema` , rather than isolated facts.**
  
- When dealing with a new concepts, experts are able to easily determine what's most worthy of attention. This is a huge advantage because they don't expend unnecessary cognitive energy (as explained in the [[01 - Mind - Mental Model|mind]] model, the attention that the working memory can provide is limited, it's important to plan a careful allocation of attention)

> The definition of schema, and the benefits of reducing the cognitive costs when dealing with a problem is not different, in my opinion, from how mental models have been defined by [[Charlie Munger]] (Found it on [[Shane Parrish]]'s Mental Models, Volume I):

## How can Experts help Novices?

Experts hold very complex and abstract schemas which are not always easy to decode into something understandable to novices.

Experts can use **Concrete examples** when conveying new ideas to novices: examples help simplifying the complexity of their schema and hold powerful properties such as understanding and durable learning (and, I would add, since experts do not disperse cognitive costs while dealing with problems or new concepts, they know how to convey a new idea with the essential information, making the examples even more effective)
