![Weekly average pace](https://storage.googleapis.com/anselboero-website-prod-images/running__base_runs_weekly_avg_pace.png)

This image shows the weekly average pace (blue line) and the average heart rate (red dotted line) of my base runs.
To me, base runs are short distance zone 3 runs: I rarely run more than 70 minutes. I run by follow my HR instead of a predetermined pace: at the moment I expect it to stay below 150 beats per minute. All the other runs are therefore excluded from this graph.

There are two horizontal lines which highlight my current targets: the light-blue one is the average pace target and the orange one represents the heart rate target.
That means, I'd like to run below 6:30 minutes per Kilometre while keeping the average heart rate below 150 beats per minute.

As you can see, I'm very far from accomplishing it. Since September 2025 my pace has slightly improved, but at cost of 3-4 beats more per minute. With the cold season, I don't expect it will get better. For instance, today Oct 5th, I went for a 8km run, but it was very windy, and keeping the HR low was quite challenging.

The image is automatically updated (on a daily basis): if you visit it in the next days you might see new nodes on the graph.
