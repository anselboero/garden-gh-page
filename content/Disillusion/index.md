# The personal diary of ...

A few days ago I received an interesting email from an unknown sender. He kindly agreed with posting its content here, such that I can skip introductions and you can get an idea yourself about this unusual request (I've omitted some personal details):

> [!Email]

> Dear Ansel,

> I've always desired publishing a personal blog, but my technical skills are quite limited, it's already a success the fact that I'm sending you this email ahah.
> I see that you are not very much active; I was thinking that maybe you could host in your website a section with my personal diary?
> This way, I don't have to learn how to create a website, and at the same time my story might attract more people and your site will finally be worth its cost (money and effort wise).
> 
> This is an example of what my journal will look like, of course you are always free to censor any kind of contents.

> [...] \<I've purposely omitted this part, because it will be published in the diary pages

> With the hope I've stimulated your curiosity, I wish you a nice day, and I hope to hear from you soon.

What a curious request.
Not worth mentioning that his digital illiteracy is real: Not sure if you have watched [Citizenfour](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4044364/), or read [No Place to Hide](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/18213403-no-place-to-hide), but for sure he's not a senior government employee in the intelligence community, and his identity was easily unveiled with a dummy query on Google.

But there is something from his email which is triggering my interest, something that's not so easy to explain, but that I hope it will become more clear in the next months.
And I hope that you might experience similar curiosity and engagement, should you decide to give him a chance.
