# Summary

![[Linear Goals - Tiny Experiments.svg]]

> [!Definition: Linear goal]
> define a target state in the future and map out the steps to get there. Success as arriving at the target.

## Linear goals stimulate Fear
- where to begin?
- not enough time or financial resources
- What if we fail?
## Linear goals encourage toxic productivity
(quoting [Idleness aversion and the Need for Justifiable Busyness](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44673229_Idleness_Aversion_and_the_Need_for_Justifiable_Busyness#:~:text=Our%20research%20suggests%20that%20many,justifications%20to%20keep%20themselves%20busy.&text=Content%20may%20be%20subject%20to%20copyright.&text=accrue%20fame%2C%20to%20protect%20one's%20territory%2C%20and%20to%20advance%20science.&text=choose%20busyness%20without%20some%20justification.) [[To-Do]])
- "many goals that people pursue may be justifications to keep themselves busy".
- speed over sustainable progress leaves us mentally drained and less productive.
> [!MyNote]
> I understand the correlation between LG and the first point, but it's not easy to draw a straight line between LG and this second point (toxic productivity): are we sure that we create (useless) goals just to keep ourselves busy, and get mentally drained from them? If yes, are we sure this is caused by LG? Maybe there are some strategies to solve these issues and make LG more sustainable: Maybe the problem is not LG but how we tackle them: for instance, eating is fundamental, but if we eat junk food we'll end up being worse than when we didn't eat at all. I don't fully agree with this point.

## Linear goals breed competition and isolation
- Constant comparison and focus on individual achievement prevent us from pooling our resources and learning from one another.
