# Reading For a Purpose

The universal purpose why we read is to **figure out** what an **author** **has to say** on a **given subject**.
But how is the author's message conveyed to the reader?

- The author's idea is translated into words.
- The reader can use and convert these words into the author's original idea.

The reader makes use of personal experiences and ideas to facilitate the re-translation process. For instance, if the author is talking about the evolution of the TV-Series, having watched many of the aforementioned Tv-Series can make the author's ideas easier to understand and enrich them through additional examples, or counter-arguments against the thesis.
At the same time, personal experiences and ideas can negatively influence the decoding process, because the reader might involuntarily project the author's ideas into their own meaning, which is usually close to their set of previous beliefs.Accurately translating text into its original meaning is a very complex activity: this book contains some suggestions about how to achieve this goal, which are grouped into 5 different "**close reading**" levels. Before diving into the fascinating world of active reading, it's worth mentioning that the close reading is a very demanding activity, and it shouldn't be done for every single piece of text we are stumbling upon: sometimes we read for our own pleasure, and it's okay not to transform an enjoyable activity into a, sometimes boring, full-time job. And it's okay not to understand the details of every single psychological trait that Dostoevsky might want to express from their characters: sometimes it's good to just let our feelings prevail over the rational understanding of a given subject.

# The Map of Knowledge

From what I understood, the concept of Map of Knowledge is not much different from the idea of Mental Models described on the [[_index|home page]].
Every discipline has got their **core ideas**, timeless principles that are fundamental for the discipline itself, and that can help explain Secondary and Peripheral concepts or ideas.
From the book these different levels are organized as a series of concentric circles: once primary ideas are mastered, learning secondary ideas will be smoother.

It's also very important being able to jump between the core ideas of different subjects: we can see the reality through different lense and with more clarity:  the reality we live in is not like a set of separated boxes, but disciplines are highly interconnected with each other.

Learning how to read is very important because it provides us with very important skills: we will be able to distinguish primary from secondary ideas, and once identified the most important concepts, we can decide to dedicate more time fully understanding them. Having mastered the fundamentals, learning minor concepts will be then easier.

# The elements of Thought
