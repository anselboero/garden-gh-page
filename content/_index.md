# Welcome

Hey there, welcome to my personal space.

I miss the old school blogs from the early 2000's, where the content was the main ingredient and everything else like SEO, cookies, ads, fancy layouts was still far from being relevant. Since many of the old blogs from the past decade are slowly fading out, I thought that adding a new one to the web might slow down their complete extinction (even if nobody will ever click to it :) )

Here I'd like to improve my writing and thinking by talking about what I care the most. Currently I have two sections in minds, which can be found on the left side of this page:

- In the [[Writing/index|Writing]] section you can find my main articles: I'll try to write about my main interest topics, such as data, learning, personal development, personal finance, and music, as well as reviews and summaries of books and movies. Each article comes with some tags, which can help you navigate through similar pages.
- In the [[Flashcards/index|Flaschards]] section each page contains short details about a specific topic or core idea. I try to keep it minimal, such that the content can be assimilated in a few minutes. 
  In order to take advantage of the [dual encoding theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-coding_theory), each flashcard consists of a visual representation of the idea plus some text enriching it.
  If you like to expand your knowledge, at the end of the page there will be a paragraph called Credit and References, containing additional links.
  More details about flashcards theory and how they are used on this blog can be found on [[On flashcards|this]] article.
