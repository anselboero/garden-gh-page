EXT - CAFÉ AM NEUEN SEE, BERLIN - AFTERNOON

2025-03-22

We see ANA reaching the place. She picks-up the phone and
opens the WhatsApp chat with JESSICA. The last message was
from Jessica: "Great, see you tomorrow at 17 at Tiergarten,
then!". The smartphone is showing it's 16.50. We see ANA
typing in: "Hey, I arrived earlier. I can order for you.
IPA?"

After a few seconds, we get the answer from Jessica: "Nice!
Yes, please. I'll be there in a few moments. <3".

Ana is approaching the Barman.

                         ANA
            Hi, I'd get an IPA, and a PALE/ALE,
            please.

                         BARMAN
            Sure.

The barman is preparing the beers.

                         BARMAN (cont'd)
            Here you are. It's 9 and 60 Euro.

Ana shows the smartphone, and the Barman prepares the POS.
ANA pays with her smartphone.

                         ANA
            Thank you very much!

                         BARMAN
            Thank you!

Ana is looking for a free table outside. Most of them are
already occupied.
She find two free spots. next to them, to the right there
is a couple (PERSON 1 and PERSON 2).

                         ANA
            Hi, are these two spots free?

                         PERSON 1
            Yes, sure.

                         ANA
            Thank you.

ANA takes a sit and takes her phone again.
She is texting to JESSICA: "I'll be waiting you here, in
the middle of the park :)". And attaches a photo of the
place to the message.

After a few seconds we see JESSICA arriving. ANA is getting
up and hugs her.

                         ANA (cont'd)
            Hey, Jessica! It's so nice to see
            you again!

                         JESSICA
            Yes, so long since we last met!

They stop hugging and they both take a sit.
They have the conversation while consuming the beers.


                         ANA
            What are you up to?

                         JESSICA
            I'm great. Thank you. Today is such
            a great day. It's so sunny. I had
            the opportunity to meet Petra in a
            cafè this morning.

                         ANA
            ohh, how is she doing? You could
            have invited her as well

                         JESSICA
            She was busy this afternoon. She is
            okay. You know, she's still
            complaining a lot about her life.
            Meeting her for a cafè is always
            challenging and energy draining, but
            I love her, it's something I do it
            with pleasure.

                         ANA
            Ohh, still stuck with her parents
            issues?

                         JESSICA
            Yes, and then the apartment has been
            without water in the past two weeks,
            she had to move to a colleague.
            Unpleasant situation.

                         ANA
            I wonder when they will definitely
            fix the pipe issues, in this city!

                         JESSICA
            ahah, yes. This is such a slow-
            moving city.
            How about you? tell me something.

                         ANA
            I'm doing good, thanks. Mark is
            still taking the screenwriting
            classes.
            And yesterday I had the last part of
            my Job Interview.

                         JESSICA
            Oh, yes. True. How did it go?

                         ANA
            It was okay. The interviewer was
            nice. he was Director of the
            department. The higher level a
            person in, the easier is talking
            with her. Because they are generally
            very good at making yourself
            comfortable. He asked details about
            myself and my current job. And then
            he asked me how many pianos there
            are in New York. Such a classic one
            in the consultancy world!

                         JESSICA
            what? How can you know how many
            pianos are there in New York?

                         ANA
            Ahah, you can't. He just wants to
            challenge my reasoning skills. It's
            about modeling a problem. You
            estimate the number of inhabitants,
            the numbers of buildings, and how
            many pianos there might be in each
            building.

                         JESSICA
            Wow, interesting. I wouldn't have
            been able to answer to that
            question.

                         ANA
            I couldn't, either, the first time I
            was asked a similar question. But
            then, you know. They all ask you the
            same questions and you start getting
            used to them.

                         JESSICA
            I see. how do you feel about the
            whole interview process?

                         ANA
            I'm confident I could get this job.
            I should get an answer next week.

                         JESSICA
            Wow, I'm so excited for you, Ana.

                         ANA
            Thank you. I'm, too.
            But tell me more about yourself. How
            are the Tinder dates going?

                         JESSICA
            Ahah, a disaster. Do you really
            wanna hear about it?

                         ANA
            Yes, of course. Let's have a good
            laugh!

                                        CUT TO:
